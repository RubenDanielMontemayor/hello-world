# hello-world
My first GitHub Repository!

Greetings everyone, my name is Ruben Daniel Montemayor. I'm very new to Git and GitHub, so I'm following an introductory tutorial to learn more about this kind of development practice. I will be using Git heavily in my COSC 4353 class at the University of Houston. I mostly know C++, with a little bit of Python and Java. I feel confident in my ability to learn new programming langauages as needed.
